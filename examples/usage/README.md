# node_id example: usage

This is a minimal app that demonstrates how to use the `node_id` component.

Build it as a standalone example:

1. Open a terminal with ESP-IDF environment exported.
2. From this folder, run:

   idf.py set-target esp32s3
   idf.py build flash monitor

The example prints the generated node ID on boot.
