summary: "Crockford Base32 node ID from factory MAC with checksum (format: XXXX-XXXC)."
description: |
  node_id provides a deterministic device identifier derived from the ESP32 factory MAC address.
  It encodes a CRC32 of the MAC into 7 Base32 (Crockford) characters and appends a 1-character
  checksum, yielding a compact 9-character token in the shape "XXXX-XXXC".

  API:
    - esp_err_t get_node_id(char **node_id, size_t *len);

  The function returns a pointer to an internal static buffer that remains valid for the lifetime
  of the process. The string is null-terminated.
